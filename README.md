# Space Invaders

### Motivation
This is my first attempt at a space invaders game. 
I have used the knowledge I have gained from various online classes and resources e.g. wesbos, udemy and codecademy.

#### Resources 
 I referenced the MDN 2D breakout game for my version of space invaders. <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript>

I have watched 2 youtube videos to help me create my version of space invaders -
